# About Me
## Things I Like
 * I have many hobbies but my current favorites are building Lego, playing video games, supporting the North Carolina Courage, watching the WNBA, and attending various pub trivias in Cary.
 * I have a BA in Psychology but have not worked in the Psych field in over 10 years. I'm excited for all the new opportunities available to me with a degree in programming!
## Websites That Bring Me Joy
* [/Eyebleach](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eyebleach/) - Sometimes you need a break from all the horrible things you can see on the internet. Eyebleach is perfect for a quick pick-me-up
* [Kitten Rescue Cam](https://explore.org/livecams/cats/kitten-rescue-cam) - Livecam of kittens playing. How can that not put a smile on your face?
* [Radio Garden](https://radio.garden/search) - Explore the globe and see what music people are listening to around the world. I think this is such a fun way to find new music!
